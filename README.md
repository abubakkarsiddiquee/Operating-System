# üñ•Ô∏è Operating System Concepts ‚Äì Lab & Theory (CSE 4509 & 4510)

**University:** United International University (UIU)    

## About
This repository contains my **lab works, assignments, projects, and lecture notes** from the Operating System Concepts course. It combines **theory** and **hands-on programming** in Linux, focusing on how operating systems manage processes, memory, synchronization, and files.  

---

## Topics Covered
- **Shell Programming** ‚Üí Linux commands, Bash scripting, automation  
- **Process & Thread Management** ‚Üí process states, system calls, CPU & thread scheduling (FCFS, SJF, RR, Priority)  
- **Synchronization & IPC** ‚Üí critical section, semaphores, monitors, inter-process communication  
- **Memory Management** ‚Üí paging, segmentation, virtual memory  
- **Deadlock Handling** ‚Üí detection, avoidance, prevention, recovery  
- **File Systems** ‚Üí structure, implementation, UNIX/Linux case studies  
- **xv6 OS Tour** ‚Üí hands-on exploration of a teaching operating system
